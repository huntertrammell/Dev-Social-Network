As the number and types of fields increase, these forms can become unmanageable. Configurable dynamic form libraries are a great alternative to hard coding, but they often don't cover all the needs of our apps. It could be that they are missing date-range pickers, min-max inputs, range sliders, etc. Or maybe they don't offer fine control over validation or styling.<br/>In this talk, we will see how to create our own dynamic forms and custom fields with Angular Forms Module and Material.</p> <p>Javascript / Not Javascript:<br/>If you have been using Typescript for a while you may have missed out on some of the new features in Javascript. Language features you thought were unique to Typescript may be available in Javascript as well. So just how different are these two today? Let's test your knowledge of the Javascript and Typescript by looking at code snippets and determining if it is Javascript or Not Javascript.</p> ",

You don't need to be a developer (beginner or otherwise) to contribute to Open Source projects. You don't need to be a developer to help mentor, coach or be involved.</p> <p>How to get to YRC:</p> <p>Traveling Westbound on 435:<br/>* Take the Roe exit and turn left. Once over the 435 bridge, take the first right into the YRC parking lot.</p> <p>Traveling Eastbound on 435:<br/>* After you pass the Metcalf Ave exit, make sure you are in the second rightmost lane (not the outermost lane) and take the Roe/Nall turn off. The outermost right lane will exit to Nall while the left lane of the turn off will continue on to Roe Ave. When you get to Roe, turn right and make the first right into the YRC parking lot.<br/>* If you accidentally exit at Nall, you can turn right on Nall and then turn left at the first stoplight which is 110th Street. Stay on 110th until you reach Roe Ave and turn left and then you can take the first left into the YRC parking lot.</p> <p>Traveling Northbound on Roe:<br/>* Stay in the left lane until you pass 110th Street and take the first left into the YRC parking lot.</p> <p>Traveling Southbound on Roe:<br/>* Stay in the right lane until you cross over 435 and take the first right into the YRC parking lot.</p> ",
